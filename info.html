            <p>Ian Roop is an American photographer and visual artist born in Charlottesville, VA, now based in California.</p> 
            <p>His most recent body of work includes an archive of film photography which chronicles San Francisco and its inhabitants from the period between 2017 – 2025. During this time the city was marked by unique challenges brought on by the pandemic, economic changes, civic upheaval, downtown vacancies, effects of the fentanyl crisis and the societal shifts caused by political turmoil and the rise of the A.I. Era. His work explores the post-pandemic environment and ongoing isolation from lockdown, alienation brought on by digital technology platforms and a desire for community engagement and make sense of a rapidly changing world.</p>
            <p>In the late 1990’s he studied photography at the Nesbitt School of Design Arts, Drexel University in Philadelphia and was one of the last generations before digital photography, the iPhone, social media and generative A.I. Originally influenced by museum visits early on in the DC area, skateboard and snowboard editorials like <em>Thrasher</em> and <em>Transworld Snowboarding</em> and other self-taught magazine photographers, as well as New Topographics and subcultures in the plaza skateboarding scenes of Love Park and Pulaski. Roop's approach to photography explores themes of multiculturalism, street style, the American West and our disconnect from nature.</p>
            <p>His humanist attitude and image making practice is a mix between the vernacular, reportage and street and road styles of photography. In his work he addresses traditional ideas about art, imagery and considers contemporary issues like climate change, mass surveillance, the urban environment, nature, job displacement due to automation and what it means to be alive today—what it means when anything you put on the Internet can be used as training data and simulated by a computer.</p>
