            <p>Ian Roop is an American photographer and visual artist born in Charlottesville, VA, now based in California.</p> 
            <p>His work explores the post-pandemic environment, multiculturalism, street style, the American West and our disconnect with nature. The most recent body of work includes an archive of film photography which chronicles changes to the city of San Francisco and its inhabitants from the period between 2017 – 2025. During this time the city faced the unique difficulties of transition and transformation brought on by the pandemic including economic challenges, civic upheaval, downtown vacancies, effects of the fentanyl crisis and societal shifts caused by the rise of the A.I. Era.</p>
            <p>In the late 1990's he studied photography in Philadelphia at the Nesbitt School of Design Arts at Drexel University and is one of the last generations before digital photography, the iPhone, social media and generative A.I. Originally influenced by museum visits early on, skateboard magazines, self-taught artists like Ari Marcopoulos and Tobin Yelland and other editorial content from the mass media. His work explores themes of lingering isolation after the pandemic, the alienation caused by technology, surveillance and the desire to engage with community and make sense of a rapidly changing world.</p>
            <p>His humanist approach is a mix between the vernacular, reportage and street and road styles of photographic picture making. His work attempts to address traditional ideas about art and consider the impact of contemporary issues like climate change, job displacement due to automation and what it means to be alive today—what human creativity means when anything you add to the Internet can be used as training data and simulated by a computer.</p>
