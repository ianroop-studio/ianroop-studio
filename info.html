            <p>Ian Roop is an American photographer and visual artist born in Charlottesville, VA, now based in California.</p> 
            <p>His most recent work includes an archive of film photography which chronicles changes to San Francisco and its inhabitants between 2017 – 2025. During this time the city was marked by unique challenges brought on by the pandemic, including periods of migration and displacement, economic instability, civic upheaval, vacancies downtown, the effects of the fentanyl crisis and societal shifts caused by political turmoil and the rise of the A.I. Era.</p>
            <p>In the late 1990s he studied photography at the Nesbitt School of Design Arts at Drexel University in Philadelphia and was one of the last generations before digital photography, the iPhone, social media and generative A.I. Originally influenced by museum visits to the Corcoran in DC, and magazine photography found in skateboard and snowboard editorials like <span class="em">Thrasher</span> and <span class="em">Transworld Snowboarding;</span> in 1996 he saw an early folio edition of Larry Clark's<span class="em">Tulsa.</span> He was also affected by historical movements in photography like New Topographics along with the plaza skateboarding scenes of Love Park and Pulaski which were meeting places for young graffiti writers, videographers, bike messengers and other artists that shaped his worldview.</p>
            <p>His humanist approach to photography continues to explore themes of multiculturalism, street style, classical portraiture, the American West and our disconnection from nature. His practice being a mix of the vernacular, reportage and street and road styles of photographic picture making and attempts to reconcile what it means to produce work when anything can be simulated by a computer or used as training data.</p>
